This License Agreement is your proof of license.  Please treat it as valuable property.

ELANIX LICENSE AGREEMENT

This is a legal agreement between you (either an individual or an entity), and ELANIX, Inc.  If you do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, promptly return the diskette and/or CD-ROM package and all accompanying items (including written materials and binders or other containers) to the place you obtained them for a full refund.

ELANIX SOFTWARE LICENSE

1.	GRANT OF LICENSE.  This ELANIX License Agreement ('License') permits you to use one copy of the specified version of the ELANIX software product identified above ('SOFTWARE') on any single computer, provided the SOFTWARE is in use on only one, computer at a time.  If you have multiple Licenses for the SOFTWARE, then at any time you may have as many copies to the software in use as you have Licenses.  The SOFTWARE is 'in use' on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e. RAM) or installed into the permanent memory (e.g. hard disk, CDROM, or other storage device) of that computer, except that a copy installed on a network server for the sole purpose of distribution to other computers is not 'in use.' If the anticipated number of users of the SOFTWARE will exceed the number of applicable Licenses, then you must have a reasonable mechanism or process in place to assure that the number of persons using the SOFTWARE concurrently does not exceed the number of Licenses.  If the  SOFTWARE is permanently installed on the hard disk or other storage device of a computer (other than a network server) and one person uses that computer more than 80% of the time it is in use, then that person may also use the SOFTWARE on a portable or home computer.

2.	COPYRIGHT.  The SOFTWARE is owned by ELANIX or its suppliers and is protected by United States copyright laws and international provisions.  Therefore you must treat the SOFTWARE like any other copyrighted material (e.g. a book or musical recording) except that you may either (a) make one copy of the SOFTWARE solely for backup purposes, or (b) transfer the SOFTWARE to a single hard disk provided you keep the original solely for backup or archival purposes.  You may not copy the written materials accompanying the SOFTWARE without the express written consent of ELANIX.

3.	OTHER RESTRICTIONS.  This License Agreement is your proof of license to exercise the rights granted herein and must be retained by you.  You may transfer your rights under this ELANIX License Agreement on a permanent basis provided you (1) transfer this License Agreement, the SOFTWARE, and all accompanying written materials and retain no copies, and the recipient agrees to the terms of this Agreement, (2) you obtain the express, written approval of ELANIX, Inc. prior to transferring the SOFTWARE.  You may not reverse engineer, de-compile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE.  You may not use the SOFTWARE for commercial purposes.  Any transfer of the SOFTWARE must include the most recent update and all prior versions.

4.	DUAL MEDIA SOFTWARE. If the SOFTWARE package contains both 3.5 inch disks and CD-ROM, then you may use only the disk(s) appropriate for your single designated computer or network server.  You may not use the other disks on another computer or computer network, or loan, rent, lease, or transfer them to another user except as part of a transfer or other use expressly permitted by this ELANIX License Agreement.


LIMITED WARRANTY.  ELANIX warrants that (a) the software will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying written materials for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of receipt; and (b) any hardware accompanying the SOFTWARE will be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service for a period of one (1) year, respectively.  Some states do not allow limitations on duration of and in implied warranty, so the above limitation may not apply to you.

CUSTOMER REMEDIES.  ELANIX's entire liability and your exclusive remedy shall be the repair or replacement of the SOFTWARE or hardware that does not meet ELANIX's Limited Warranty and that is returned to ELANIX with a copy of your receipt.  This Limited Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE or hardware has resulted from accident, abuse, or misapplication.  Any replacement SOFTWARE will be warranted for the remainder of the original period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer.  Neither these remedies nor any product support services offered by ELANIX are available for this U.S.A. and Canada version product outside the United States of America or Canada.

NO OTHER WARRANTIES.  ELANIX disclaims all other warranties, either express or implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose, with respect to the SOFTWARE, the accompanying materials, and any accompanying hardware.  This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights.  You may have others, which vary from state to state.

NO LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES.  In no event shall ELANIX or its suppliers be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, damages for loss of business profits, business interruption, loss of business information, or other pecuniary loss) arising out of the use of or inability to use this ELANIX product, even if ELANIX has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential damages, the above limitation may not apply to you.
